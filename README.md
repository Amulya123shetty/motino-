# Motion Detection Project

## Overview

This project implements a motion detection system using computer vision techniques. The system captures video input from a camera, processes the frames to detect motion, and can trigger alerts or actions based on detected movement.

## Features

- Real-time motion detection
- Adjustable sensitivity settings
- Option to save video clips of detected motion
- Email or SMS alerts when motion is detected
- Simple user interface for configuration

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Other dependencies (as listed in `requirements.txt`)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/motion-detection.git
   cd motion-detection
Install the required packages:

Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Ensure you have a camera connected to your system.

Usage
To run the motion detection script, use the following command:

Copy
python motion_detection.py
Configuration
You can adjust the sensitivity and other settings in the config.py file.

Example
Hereâ€™s an example of how the motion detection works:

The system captures video from the camera.
It processes each frame to detect changes.
If motion is detected, it triggers an alert and can save a video clip.
